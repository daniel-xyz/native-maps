# NativeMaps

An **experimental** React Native maps library.

It’s my first native module project, built as a way to learn React Native’s New Architecture and platform-native languages (Swift, Kotlin).

> **Disclaimer:** This library is in early development and will change often.  
> Use it for learning or experimentation - **not** production apps.

## Goals

🚀 **Performance-focused** - built with Fabric for native rendering speed  
🍏 **Cross-platform** - Apple MapKit on iOS, Google Maps on Android  
🔌 **Native APIs** - expose rich platform APIs  
📍 **Marker clustering** - handled natively and in real-time

## Roadmap

### ✅ Done

- Basic Apple Maps view with props

### 🚧 In Progress

- Apple Maps: markers & `onPress` events

### 📅 Planned

- Apple Maps: custom markers
- Fully native marker clustering
- Google Maps: basic view with props
- Google Maps: markers & `onPress` events
- Google Maps: custom markers
- Publish library to npm

### 🧪 Long-term ideas and experiments

- Explore using NitroModules
- Google Maps for iOS
