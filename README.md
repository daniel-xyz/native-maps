# NativeMaps

An **experimental** React Native maps library. It's my first native module project, built as a way to learn React Native’s new architecture and platform-native languages.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress and **not production-ready**.

## Goals

- 🚀 **Performance-focused** using TurboModules, Fabric, and NitroModules
- 🍏 **Cross-platform** support for Apple MapKit (iOS) and Google Maps (Android)
- 📍 **Marker clustering** built-in and real-time
- 🔌 **Production-ready** sometime in the future

## Roadmap / TODO

- [x] Initialize project with `create-expo-module`
- [ ] Implement a basic MapKit view (render map in React Native)
- [ ] Add props (center coordinate, zoom, markers)
- [ ] Handle user interaction events (tap, region change)
- [ ] Add custom marker support (images, touch events)
- [ ] Implement native marker clustering for iOS
- [ ] Optimize collision and clustering with NitroModules
- [ ] Write examples, documentation, and tests
- [ ] Add Google Maps (Android) support
