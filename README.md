# NativeMaps

An **experimental** React Native maps library. It's my first native module project, built as a way to learn React Native’s new architecture and platform-native languages.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress and **not production-ready**.

## Goals

- 🚀 **Performance-focused** using TurboModules, Fabric, and NitroModules
- 🍏 **Cross-platform** support for Apple MapKit (iOS) and Google Maps (Android)
- 📍 **Marker clustering** built-in and real-time
- 🔌 **Production-ready** sometime in the future

## Roadmap

### Apple Maps (iOS)

- [x] Basic AppleMaps view with props
- [ ] Markers and onPress events
- [ ] Custom markers

### Google Maps (Android)

- [ ] Basic GoogleMaps view with props
- [ ] Markers and onPress events
- [ ] Custom markers

### Further away

- [ ] Fully native Marker Clustering (not depending on React render cycle)
- [ ] Publish library to npm

### Even further away and might never happen

- [ ] Google Maps for iOS
- [ ] Web Support
